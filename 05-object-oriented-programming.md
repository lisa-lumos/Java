# 5. Object Oriented Programming (OOP)
Inheritance, Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Composition. 

OOP is a way to model real world objects, as software objects, which contain data (state) and code (behavior). Classes are blueprint for objects. 

If a field is static, there is only one copy in memory, and this value is associated with the class itself.
